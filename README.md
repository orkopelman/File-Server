# File-Server
Files Managment in a Server-Client system using TCP communciation. 

// Project Goal:
// Create file access over TCP/IP connection
// Client opens file on server computer, using TCP/IP connection, reads data, closes file

// Steps and requirements:
// 1. Implement client based on abstract "class nfs"
// 2. Implement server, abstract class and concrete implementions
// 3. Suggest basic protocol between client and server
// 4. Several files can be open at the same time
// 5. Several clients can use server at the same time

// Assumption and directions
// 1. working code is not expected, pseudo-code in C++ syntax
// 2. TCP implmentation may be schematic, can skip details (flags, includes, and other stuff are not required)
// 3. Describe messages in both directions
// 4. Pay attention to interfaces (class methods)
